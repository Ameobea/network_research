# Network Research
Misc. files for network research

Not intended for official release or publication, but if you find them useful in some way please make use of them.

## Dependencies
* `pip install networkx`
* `pip install matplotlib`

## Running
Execute either the `run.sh` or `run.bat` files to start the processing pipeline.  This assumes that your network files are in a directory called `networks` in the project root directory; results will be output to the root directory as well.
